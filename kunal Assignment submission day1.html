    <h4>1.PIKACHU</h4>
    The Pokémon anime series and films feature the adventures
    Ketchum and his Pikachu, traveling through the various 
    regions of the Pokémon universe. They are accompanied by
    a group of alternating friends, including Misty, Brock, 
    Tracey, May, Max, Dawn, Iris, Cilan, Bonnie, Serena, 
    Clemont, Lillie, Kiawe, Mallow, Lana, Sophocles, and Goh.
     In the first episode, Ash Ketchum, a young boy from 
     Pallet Town, turns 10 years old and is ready to acquire 
     his first Pokémon. Hopeful to become a Pokémon Master, 
     the night before he receives his starter Pokémon (either 
     Squirtle, Charmander or Bulbasaur) he has a dream where 
     he is catching a Pokémon and actually, while sleeping, 
     physically breaks his alarm clock (designed like a Poke 
     Ball). Ash quickly runs to Professor Oak's lab, where he 
     finds out all the starter Pokémon have been given away. 
     Professor Oak tells Ash there is one more Pokémon, a male 
     Pikachu. At first, Pikachu largely ignores Ash's requests, 
     shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the 
     conventional method of Pokémon transportation, a Poké 
     Ball. However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend 
     Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, then rushes the 
     electric mouse to a Pokémon Center. Through these 
     demonstrations of respect and unconditional commitment to 
     Pokémon, Pikachu warms up to Ash, and their friendship is 
     formed. However, he still refuses to go into his Poké Ball.

    <h5>2.BULBASAUR</h5>
    Bulbasaur (/ˈbʌlbəˌsɔːr/), known as Fushigidane (フシギダネ) 
    in Japan,[2] is the first Pokémon in Nintendo and Game 
    Freak's Pokémon franchise's monster dictionary, called a 
    Pokédex. Designed by Atsuko Nishida,[1] Bulbasaur debuted 
    in Pokémon Red and Blue as a Starter Pokémon. Since then, 
    it has reappeared in subsequent sequels, spin-off games, 
    related merchandise, and animated and printed adaptations 
    of the franchise.
    Known as the Seed Pokémon, Bulbasaur can survive for days 
    solely on sunlight. It likes to take a nap in the sunshine. 
    While it sleeps, the seed on its back catches the rays and 
    uses the energy to grow. It is a central character in the 
    anime, being one of Ash's main Pokémon for the first season, 
    and a different one later being obtained by May. It is 
    featured in various manga, and is owned by protagonist Red 
    in the Pokémon Adventures manga. Bulbasaur has been featured 
    in myriad pieces of merchandise, including toys, key chains, 
    and plush dolls.
    Bulbasaur can evolve into Ivysaur at level 16, and can 
    further evolve into Venusaur at level 32. Venusaur can also 
    evolve into Mega Venusaur if the player equips it with a 
    Venusaurite, but this feature was only first added to the 
    Pokémon games in Pokémon X and Y.

    <h6>3.CHARIZARD</h6>
    Charizard (/ˈtʃɑːrɪzɑːrd/), known in Japan as Lizardon 
    (リザードン, Rizādon), is a Pokémon in Nintendo and Game 
    Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Atsuko Nishida, 
    Charizard first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and 
    Blue (Pokémon Red and Green in Japan) and subsequent sequels. 
    They have later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff 
    titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. 
    It is known as the Flame Pokémon. Shin-ichiro Miki, 
    the actor who voices James in the original Japanese version 
    of the Pokémon anime, voices Charizard in both the Japanese 
    and English-language versions of the anime. An orange, 
    draconic Pokémon, Charizard is the evolved form of Charmeleon 
    and the final evolution of Charmander. It also has two Mega 
    Evolved forms, Mega Charizard X and Y, that were likely 
    both designed by Tomohiro Kitakaze, the designer of Mega 
    Charizard X,and are not permanent and always revert to the 
    normal Charizard form once a battle is complete. It also has 
    a Gigantamax form in Pokémon Sword and Shield, which changes 
    its appearance and size for 3 turns, until it is Knocked Out, 
    until it is returned, or until the battle ends.
